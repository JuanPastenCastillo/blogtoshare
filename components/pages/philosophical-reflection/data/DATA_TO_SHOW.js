      `What is philosophy? When we say "it's the love of wisdom," is this enough to define it? Why is it that when a student studies or a teacher teaches a subject with passion, they are not called a philosopher? What distinguishes philosophy from other disciplines? Lyotard provides some answers to this by saying that when we try to answer "what is philosophy," there is always something that escapes us. That's why it's better to change the question to "why philosophize?" And with that, we can follow a clue: the love of wisdom, and if we talk about love, we talk about desire: what is desire? Desire is presence and absence, that is its nature. To understand it better, let's review Plato's myth about the birth of desire: it is the son of Poros and Penia, the former being the richest God of all and Penia the poorest. The myth says that during a great banquet in Olympus, Poros got drunk and fell asleep, and Penia, who was always begging, saw the sleeping, drunk, and defenseless god and seized the opportunity to conceive a child with him. This is how desire is born, the child of wealth that has everything and poverty that astutely begs to obtain something. Desire possesses that double nature: it achieves the greatest wealth when it wants (because of its father) but the moment it obtains them, it becomes irreparably poor (because of its mother), and in the newly acquired poverty, it begins the search for wealth again. Desire is born again and again from the ashes, like the phoenix.`,
      `It should be noted that the desire presented here is not limited to sexuality. Let's take an example with the philosopher Socrates, famous for his wisdom and teaching. He could never exchange those qualities that made him famous, not because there were no things in this world of equivalent value, but because the teaching of something leaves an absence when it is present and can only be present when there are absences. Socrates understood that his questions emptied out so that they could be filled, and once they were filled, he emptied them out again with more questions. The wisdom of this philosopher sought the "why" without discriminating against any subject it touched.`,
      `So why philosophize? Well, because we desire, and why do we seek something we don't have? Well, at this point, the answer is the same: because I want to, because I feel like it. This is a correct answer, but it is not profound. And if we look elsewhere, for example, what is the origin of philosophy? Well, something was already said: it is born of desire. But it is worth noting: the birth of desire is a myth and as a myth, it has no before or after. Philosophy is, in that sense, an eternal present and thus, we can affirm that we are contemporaries of Socrates and Aristotle, we can speak to them as equals. Philosophy is characterized by treating causality in reverse, it is the present that determines the past: today we give meaning to what other people said in the past and we do that thanks to interpretation, which is done today, in the present.`,
      `Then philosophy never emerged in time as we know it, nothing ever happened that inaugurated it. That is why it is useless to search for philosophy in history, since it is history itself, a discontinuous chain of questions and desires for action. Every philosopher starts from scratch, never inherits, rather creates and asks questions of those who have already lived (the past), but always with a new voice. That is, each philosopher does not try to repeat or destroy, but rather seeks to resignify and question in a different way.`,
      `Is there an answer to the origin of philosophy? Yes, it is in this day, in every day. And when do we know that we are doing philosophy? When we use a philosophical word, which is a special type of word that seeks meaning. Let us remember the word 'desire', this term has its origin in the stars, in the observation of the sky. It is said that when the gods do not speak, desire, the urge, appears. To say 'desire' is the same as saying 'the gods are silent'. Philosophy begins when the gods are silent.`,
      `Philosophy is made with words and we think with words. When words are lacking, so is thought itself. The philosophical task lies in giving sense, even to words devoid of it such as "hello, how are you?" or "what have you been up to?" We are the ones who interpret texts, and it is so much so that we cannot stop doing it. We are, so to speak, obliged to grant meaning. That word with meaning manifests itself when it circulates in communication with another. Communicating is being in language, in thought, and in sociability. Thus we understand, always in relation to the other, not dissecting its parts. This philosophical word seeks to reconcile us with the world, which is different from the scientific and religious words. The scientific word seeks to speak of the things of the world without things being able to object. The world, for science, responds simply: "yes," "no," or "that doesn't matter." The scientific word is not the whole truth, it is a type of truth, prestigious and generalizable. As for the religious word, it is effective when heard by people of its own culture. And now, what makes the philosophical word so special? It is neither religion nor science, it does not predict verifiable truths... what does it do? It is simple: it gives sense. Perhaps the philosophical task is only to oversee that there is sense and to let others produce that sense (which is better). The other thing that philosophy does is turn to itself to search for the meaning of what it itself says, which is not for everyone. That kind of philosophy requires listeners to be poets or dreamers.`,
      `And in the end, what is philosophy good for? Well, for nothing. When we think, there is never a definitive conclusion, we always need more. As young Marx once said, "philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point, however, is to change it."`,
      `There is another point of view of philosophy, let us take the perspective of the thinker Hannah Arendt. She distinguishes three activities that mark the human condition: labor, work, and action. Labor is in charge of maintaining life, its biological aspect. It does not pursue any goal and will repeat as long as life lasts. Work does have a defined beginning, as well as a determined and predictable end. It is a reversible process that needs hands to be produced and uses a means to achieve a certain end. Finally, action, that activity that identifies us as truly human beings. It also has a defined beginning but its end is unpredictable. Unlike work, this is irreversible because what action does cannot be undone and depends on other human beings, on their fellow beings, to be carried out. These human beings always have a double character: they are equal and different. We know they are equal because we can understand each other and prevent future needs, and we know they are different because of each one's identity, which develops in the intimate relationship of some with others: we all create our identities among the diversity of human beings. This identity allows every human being to distinguish themselves from those who exist, existed, or will exist and makes them, at the same time, dependent on discourse and acts to understand each other. With the dependence on discourse and act, human beings take the initiative to manifest their freedom. Words and acts are like a second birth in the world. The first birth, the biological one, incorporates us into the world as something new, as a miracle for having been improbable and unpredictable. Now the action: we know where our words and acts begin, but we do not know where they will end: we cannot stop, predict, or control their consequences, once they begin they become trapped in a network of human affairs. The human being is capable, with their action and identity, of the improbable and the unpredictable, always together with others. These gifts were given to us from our births.`,
      `People introduce themselves to each other with their words and actions, interweaving relationships and coexisting with others. This web of relationships and coexistence is colored by conflicts and intentions that involve the freedoms of individuals.`,
      `And here lies the importance of words and actions, to achieve this we must think and judge the particular situation. We are thinking beings, we always have been, we use this faculty to go beyond the limits of knowledge and exercise a capacity for something more than doing and knowing. Thought has not only created organized knowledge (exact, natural, human or social sciences, etc.), but also considers the search for meaning and significance. Here, we're not talking about thought that seeks the truths of scientific research, which are evidenced by the senses, seeking whether something exists or not. We're talking about thought as the giving of meaning, regardless of whether something exists or not, rather what its existence means (assuming something exists). Understanding is sought through this, it is an attempt to reconcile ourselves with reality, to try to feel in harmony with the world. Understanding does not have an end, it does not produce a definitive result, rather it is a way of living from which each person can reconcile themselves with the world where they were born, where they will always be a foreign (because you are unique in a world where no one is like you and never has been, nor ever will be).`,
      `That understanding which leads us to reconcile ourselves with what we do and suffer does not mean accepting everything or forgiving everything, nor is it necessary to understand or reconcile in order to act. In the end, the point of understanding is to give knowledge a meaning.`,
      `And now to judgment: the one who judges is a spectator in a privileged position who understands the sense of the game and does not participate in it, while the actor (while acting) cannot have such a vision because they play a role within the game. The spectator is not independent of the opinions of others, quite the contrary. Only the spectator can know all the consequences of the acts.`,
      `To judge and think is not a dialogue with oneself, but rather an anticipated dialogue with others, with whom one knows that at some point agreement will be reached. Potentially, it will happen, which is why it is valid to think and judge. Here imagination comes into play, because thanks to it, we can think in the place of the other, not exactly being the other, but imagining what would be possible being the other. Imagining this while considering the other is understood as critical thinking, because it considers the other's point of view.`,
      `Thinking and judgment are framed within democracy: it is not the privilege of anyone to judge or think about actions, it is something that we can all have access to.`,
      `To resume action: even the smallest act in the most limited circumstances has unlimited and unforeseeable consequences (an act, a gesture, a word, is enough to change any constellation). When we work, we know what we are doing and where it will end, but when we act, we never know. Since every action is irreversible, there are only two ways to counteract it: promise and forgiveness. Forgiveness is related to the past and allows us to undo what has been done. Along with a promise, it provides particles of security that authorize us to move forward.`,
      `Therefore, others are important when we talk about action, through the dialogue and acts that we can have with them. With today's widespread use of technology and social media, we must not confuse it with true dialogue, since social media attempts to replace communities. While we belong to a community, the network belongs to us (we can add people, delete them, block them, start or end conversations whenever we want, and here all social skills are irrelevant). And it is these absent skills on the network that need to be developed in everyday life, through direct human contact in shared, public or private spaces, where we can dialogue and negotiate (streets, certain workspaces, among others). Real dialogue, says Zygmunt Bauman, is establishing a relationship with people who do not think like you.`,
      `It is precisely in today's society where we need dialogue, a society that has been profiled by the philosopher Byung Chul Han. He says that we live in a performance society that demands its inhabitants to always give more, "you can be better" is their motto, but between the lines, this means "I demand that you improve". Before, society used to say: "you can because you must", the emphasis was on duty, that was above everything else, but today things are reversed: "you must because you can", if the emphasis is on "can" then anything that can be done, you must do it. Thus, we see that despite all technological advancements and new trends in terms of productivity, relationships, entertainment, and so on, the individual is expected to rise to the occasion. In this sense, the capitalism that surrounds us uses emotions, psyche, and information as raw materials to exploit people.`,
      `There was a time when people fought to limit working hours and clearly divide them from leisure time, but today that division is increasingly blurred because when we finish our workday, we enter certain devices, such as our mobile phones, to continue producing (even if it's not related to work) because we are giving data to many companies that then trade on our privacy.`,
      `How is this sustained? Well, with self-help, neuroscience, and legal drugs. Self-help books such as "Be a Leader in 10 Steps or Less" encourage the logic of efficiency. Neuroscience conducts experiments to increase people's efficiency, and the new drugs manufactured in this society are focused on the same goal. This inevitably generates an internal violence, imposed from the outside, that people direct against themselves, generating the diseases of our era: depression, anxiety, attention deficit, chronic stress (burnout), and even cancer. These illnesses are the other side of performance, the people who could not meet demands that are not their own, with external goals, who thought that only under an immense demand they could "climb" in job hierarchies, social structures, etcetera. Many people suffer from these diseases.`,
      `On those diseases, Nietzsche has something to say: there are certain people who try to "improve" humanity, and in the name of "improving" them, great atrocities have been committed against life and against instincts, because their "improvement" weakens. Christianity, for example, made people consider themselves sinners, with terrible ideas inside them, even despising themselves. They managed to make many people sick by hurting them. The same was done by Hindu morality.`,
      `Therefore, we must be attentive to the means used to achieve some noble end such as "improvement," and questions can help with this. What are the means proposed to "improve"? Do these means weaken or strengthen you? If you know that they weaken you and you are told "it's for your own good," are you willing to voluntarily weaken yourself to achieve that end?`,
      `Nowadays we're supposed to be living in secular times, which means that religion isn't the center of our lives and it's not God who gives us meaning. It was Nietzsche himself who identified that God had died. However, the philosopher pointed out that when God died, the sense that He gave didn't disappear; rather, it scattered everything it contained. Now there are little gods with different degrees of power, they're called friendship, love, loyalty, justice, and any other value. At some point, the following phrase was attributed to the writer Fyodor Dostoevsky: "If God does not exist, then everything is permitted." But this was later rethought by a philosopher named Slavoj Zizek, who said: "It is the opposite. If God exists, then everything is permitted." This means that in the name of God or in the name of justice, loyalty, honor, love, etc., we can justify acts that would otherwise be unjustifiable. Let's try to ask the right question. What are we willing to do for love? What have we already done for love? What things do we allow to happen for love? In these questions, we can replace the word love with justify, loyalty, and so on. In other words, do we know what our god is? Do we know its name? Do we know in the name of what we are willing to make sacrifices, to allow things to happen, or to be an active agent in making things happen? What is our god?`,
      `So what path to follow? To emphasize an answer and not a question, we have Tony Wagner, a renowned global educator, who was interviewed by Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, who asked the following question to his interviewee: What skills will be the most important for our children to learn in the future? The answer was:`,
      `«The skills necessary for working, learning, and being citizens of the 21st century have been unified, they are the same skills (...) A student must learn to think critically (...) Today, knowing how to ask good questions is much more important than recognizing easy answers. The second necessary skill is the ability to collaborate. Increasingly, all work is done collaboratively. The third is to have good communication skills, both oral and written, as well as for listening. Finally, they must solve problems creatively.»`
